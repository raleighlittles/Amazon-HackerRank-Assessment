# About

This repository contains my solutions to Amazon's HackerRank assessment for Software Development Engineers.

This assessment consisted of:

* 57 behavioral questions -- see `behavioral.md`
* Two (2) programming questions: "Algorithm Swap" and "Robot Rodeo".

Inside each directory is a README.md that contains all the information provided within the HackerRank question itself.
Each question also has tests, which are taken from the test cases on the question itself. Unfortunately there are a
large amount of hidden test cases on HackerRank questions, so the unit tests are very limited as I could only use the public
test cases for those.

After each programming question, you're asked two questions about your approach.

1. Briefly describe your approach for solving this code question.
2. What is the run time complexity of your solution for this code question?
