# About

Each question has two statements, where the candidate is asked to indicate how closely either of the statements applies
to them. The gotcha is that you can only choose one statement out of the two -- you cannot indicate that both statements
apply to you.

Here is a diagram of how the UI selection form looks:

```
"I do not believe that pineapple belongs on pizza."                                                     "I believe that any food that tastes good should be used as a pizza topping."
